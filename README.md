# First PHP project

> [!NOTE]
> I wanted to try out PHP and build a simple webpage with some backend and login and registration forms. Actually didn't know much about how this worked when I did it. Part of the reson why I did this small project.
It could been built on more, but you got to try to priotize what you learn in a good order to make all the pieces come together more easyily. Now I have more knowledge, and what I wanted to do here was not optimal for that purpose but was good learning path to understand a bit more about GET request and POST request etc.
Mayby will jump on PHP in the future again, when I got more meat on my bones in the web backend. For now it feels most straight forward to dig in deeper to node.js to learn alot of fundamentals handling a server.
Posting data, and getting data, with a database or for purpose of learning just using json file to store data with body-parser and express.
