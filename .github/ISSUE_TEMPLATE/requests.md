Im learning git, and trying alot, sometimes sitting houers failing trying to create workflows. Because i dont know enought about yalm files and node.js for example but reading up on it.

If you have any suggestions on what i should do involving all subjects, security, command line, pushing projects, creating respitory to use and how to use command line to work from.

I am reading up on all information i can find. Its alot, like Nutget etc also is new to me so its alot to learn wich is good but can be frustrating.

This is only information for my profile.
